# Extending the Bonus "Watch Backpropagation Happen" Section

## What you're extending

The **Bonus: Watch backpropagation happen** section inspects
`first_layer_gradients.numpy()[400, :5]` — the gradients connecting pixel index 400 (roughly the
centre of the image) to 5 of the first layer's 128 neurons — and explains that centre pixels tend
to have large, varied gradients while corner pixels (which MNIST digits never touch) have
gradients of exactly 0. This guide turns that single-pixel spot-check into a full picture across
every pixel.

## Why this matters

Reading one pixel at a time makes the point, but it's easy to look at a single number and not
really *feel* the pattern. Visualising the gradient magnitude across the entire 28x28 image at
once turns "corners are 0, the centre is bigger" from an assertion into something you can see
directly — and reveals shape detail (a soft ring where digit strokes typically pass) that
spot-checking a handful of indices would never show.

## How to do it

### 1. Re-run the setup

Run the cells up through the one that computes `gradients = tape.gradient(loss_value,
model.trainable_variables)` and `first_layer_gradients = gradients[0]`, so that tensor exists.

### 2. Average across all 128 neurons, and reshape into an image

`first_layer_gradients` has shape `(784, 128)` — one row per input pixel, one column per hidden
neuron. Averaging the *magnitude* of gradients across each row (across all 128 neurons) gives one
number per pixel, which reshapes neatly back into a 28x28 image:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Average the absolute gradient across all 128 neurons, for each of the 784 pixels
avg_abs_gradient = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(first_layer_gradients), axis=1)   # shape: (784,)
gradient_image = avg_abs_gradient.numpy().reshape(28, 28)

plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))
plt.imshow(gradient_image, cmap="hot")
plt.colorbar(label="Average |gradient|")
plt.title("Which pixels the first layer's gradient cares about")
plt.show()
```

### 3. Compare it against an actual average digit

To confirm the gradient map lines up with where digits actually have ink, compare it side by side
with the average of several real training images:

```python
average_digit = sample_images.mean(axis=0)   # average over the same 32-image batch used above

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))
axes[0].imshow(average_digit, cmap="gray")
axes[0].set_title("Average pixel brightness\n(across the same batch of real digits)")
axes[1].imshow(gradient_image, cmap="hot")
axes[1].set_title("Average |gradient|\n(first layer, same batch)")
plt.show()
```

## What to observe / think about

- **The two images should look similar in outline**: both should be brightest in a rough
  ring/blob covering the centre of the canvas, and close to zero at all four corners — pixels
  that never contain ink can't affect the loss, so they can't have a nonzero gradient either,
  exactly as the notebook's single-pixel example showed for index 400 (centre) vs. index 0
  (corner).
- **They won't match exactly.** The gradient depends on the *current* batch's labels and the
  model's current (imperfect) predictions, not just on where ink typically is — so expect a
  noisier, less symmetric pattern than the clean average-brightness image.
- **Try this again after training for more epochs** (see
  [`01_more_epochs_and_layers.md`](01_more_epochs_and_layers.md)) — as the model gets better,
  gradients for a well-classified image should generally shrink in magnitude, since there's less
  room left to improve on an already-confident, correct prediction.
- **Try it on `gradients[2]` instead** (the second Dense layer's `(128, 10)` weight matrix). It
  reshapes differently (rows are hidden-layer features, not pixels), but is worth comparing
  against the first layer's gradients — they answer different questions ("which pixels matter" vs.
  "which hidden-layer features matter for each digit").

## Related ideas worth knowing about

- **Saliency maps**: instead of the *weight* gradients used here, computing the gradient of the
  loss with respect to the *input image itself* (`tape.watch(sample_images)`, with
  `sample_images` converted to a `tf.Variable` or watched explicitly) produces a map of which
  pixels of one specific drawing most influenced its prediction — a common real-world
  explainability technique, and a natural next step after this exercise.
- **Grad-CAM**: a more sophisticated version of the same idea, designed for CNNs (see
  [`02_try_the_cnn.md`](02_try_the_cnn.md)), that highlights which *regions* of an image most
  drove a particular prediction.
